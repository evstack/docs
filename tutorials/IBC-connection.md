# IBC connection tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use [relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer) to
create a IBC connection between [GM world](/tutorials/gm-world) rollup and a osmosis local testnet.

## ðŸ’» Pre-requisites

### Software requirement

* Docker running on your machine
* Go version >= 1.21.0

## Run a GM rollup chain

Before you can create IBC connection, you need to start a
local-celestia-devnet instance in a separate terminal:

```bash
docker run -t -i --platform linux/amd64 -p 26650:26650 -p 26657:26657 -p 26658:26658 -p 26659:26659 -p 9090:9090 ghcr.io/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet:v0.12.6
```

And we start the GM chain by using this script :

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollkit/docs/main/scripts/gm/init-local.sh
sh init-full-node.sh
```

## Run your local-osmosis-testnet

### Install osmosis binary

```sh
git clone https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis
cd osmosis
git checkout v21.0.2
make install
```

### Run local-osmosis-testnet

You also need to start local-osmosis-testnet in a separate terminal by download and run this script

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollkit/docs/main/scripts/ibc/init-osmosis-local.sh
```

This will start your local osmosis testnet, we'll create IBC connection between this testnet and GM chain in next step.
> NOTE: Here, the keys name from `init-osmosis-local.sh` is `mykey` and `relay_osmosis` but you can modify
  this script to change the name of your key.

::: tip
We're using the `--rpc.addr [ip:port]` flag to point to port 46657, which is
the custom port to avoid with other runnig chains.

## Funds

The following private key has funds on your Osmosis chain:

```bash
Keyname: osmosis-relay
Address: osmo1vvl79phavqruppr6f5zy4ypxy7znshrqm390ll
Mnemonic: "milk verify alley price trust come maple will suit hood clay exotic"
```

The following private key has funds on your GM rollup chain:

```bash
Keyname: gm-relay
Address: gm1vvl79phavqruppr6f5zy4ypxy7znshrqam48qy
Mnemonic: "milk verify alley price trust come maple will suit hood clay exotic"
```

## Setup relayer, create IBC connection and start relay packet

A relayer is like a middleman for blockchains in the IBC protocol. Instead of directly talking to each other, blockchains communicate through relayers. These relayers keep an eye on the paths that are open between different blockchains. When there's something new or changed, the relayer makes sure the message gets sent to the right place on the other blockchain.

Apart from just passing messages, a relayer can also set up new paths between blockchains. This involves creating clients, connections, and channels, which are like communication channels between the blockchains. So, in simpler terms, a relayer makes sure blockchains can talk to each other smoothly.

### Install relayer

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/relayer
cd relayer
git checkout v2.4.2
make install
```

Verify your rly version with `rly version`. It should return :

```sh
version: 2.4.2
commit: 259b1278264180a2aefc2085f1b55753849c4815 (dirty)
cosmos-sdk: v0.47.5
go: go1.21.4 darwin/arm64
```

### Setup relayer config

Firstly, generate an empty config file with this command:

```sh
rly config init
```

Afterward, edit the file in the directory `$HOME/.relayer/config/config.yaml` with any text editor you prefer. Then, paste this configuration into it.

```config

    api-listen-addr: :5183
    timeout: 10s
    memo: ""

            max-gas-amount: 1000000
            debug: true
            timeout: 20s
            block-timeout: ""
            output-format: json
            sign-mode: direct
            extra-codecs: []
            coin-type: 118
            signing-algorithm: ""
            broadcast-mode: batch
            min-loop-duration: 0s
            extension-options: []
            feegrants: null
paths: {}
```

### Create relayer account

Add keys for each chain with this command

The mnemonic-words is the mnemonic that you have when init local node, ensure that each wallet have token to start relaying.

```sh
rly keys restore osmo-local default "milk verify alley price trust come maple will suit hood clay exotic"
rly keys restore gm-local default "milk verify alley price trust come maple will suit hood clay exotic"
```

### Create IBC channel

Create a new blank path to be used in generating a new path (connection and client) between two chains

```sh
rly paths new osmosis-testnet-1 gm osmo-gm
```

and then you can create channel with this command

```sh
rly transact link osmo-gm
```

This is a triplewammy, it creates a client, connection, and channel all in one command.

Alternatively, you may create them one by one using these commands:

```sh
rly transact clients osmo-local gm-local osmo-gm
rly transact connection osmo-gm
rly transact channel osmo-gm --src-port transfer --dst-port transfer --order unordered --version ics20-1
```

At the end, it should return something like this :

```bash

```

### Start relaying packet

After completing all these steps, you can start relaying with:

```sh
rly start
```

IBC transfer tokens between `osmosis-testnet-1` and `gm` are now possible.

### Transfer token from rollup chain to osmosis-local

Make an ibc-transfer transaction. This tx will transfer 1000000stake from `gm-key`  to receiver address in your local-osmosis chain.

```sh
gmd tx ibc-transfer transfer transfer [src-channel] [receiver_address] [amount] --node tcp://localhost:36657 --chain-id gm --from gm-key
```

Then check the balance of the receiver address to see if the token has been relayed or not.

```sh
osmosisd query bank balances [receiver_address] --node tcp://localhost:46657 --chain-id osmosis-testnet-1
```

The balances query command should return something like this:

```bash
balances:
- amount: "1000000"
  denom: ibc/64BA6E31FE887D66C6F8F31C7B1A80C7CA179239677B4088BB55F5EA07DBE273
- amount: "106833473"
  denom: uosmo
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

### Transfer token back from osmosis-local to rollup chain

Make an ibc-transfer transaction

```sh
osmosisd tx ibc-transfer transfer transfer [src-channel] [receiver] [amount] --node tcp://localhost:46657 --chain-id osmosis-testnet-1 --from osmosis-relayer
```

And then check the balances of the receiver address with if it the token is relayed or not

```sh
gmd query bank balances [receiver_address] --node tcp://localhost:36657 
```

The balances query command should return something like this:

```bash
balances:
- amount: "1000000"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
