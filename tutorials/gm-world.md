description: Build a sovereign rollup using only Rollkit CLI and a local DA network.

# GM world rollup

## 🌞 Introduction {#introduction}

This tutorial will guide you through building a sovereign `gm-world` rollup (`gm` stands for "good morning") using Rollkit. Unlike the [quick start guide](https://rollkit.dev/tutorials/quick-start), this tutorial provides a more practical approach to understanding sovereign rollup development.

We will cover:

- Building and configuring a Cosmos-SDK application-specific rollup blockchain.
- Posting rollup data to a Data Availability (DA) network.
- Executing transactions (the end goal).

No prior understanding of the build process is required, just that it utilizes the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) for blockchain applications.

## 🛠️ Dependencies {#dependencies}

As we move into more advanced use cases, we use [kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/) to help with managing all the services we need to run. You can [install kurtosis here](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install). 

Once installed, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
$ kurtosis version

CLI Version:   0.90.1

To see the engine version (provided it is running): kurtosis engine status
```

## 🚀 Starting your rollup {#start-your-rollup}

Now that we have kurtosis installed, we can launch our GM rollup along with the local DA by running the following command:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/rollkit/gm@v0.3.0
```

You should see an output like this:

```bash

Kurtosis has successfully launched the GM rollup and the local DA network. The GM rollup is running on port `26657` and the local DA network is running on port `7980`. You can see the services running in docker as well:

```bash

We can see the GM rollup running in container `gm--ed0233f8291d4a42bdd0e173393af809` and the local DA network running in container `local-da--990942dc84ab4b3ab2c8d64002a5bafa`.

You can verify the rollup is running by checking the logs:

Good work so far, we have a Rollup node, DA network node, now we can start submitting transactions.

## 💸 Transactions {#transactions}

Since our rollup is running in a docker container, we want to enter the docker container to interact with it via the Rollkit CLI. We can do this by running:

```bash
docker exec -it gm--ed0233f8291d4a42bdd0e173393af809 sh
```

First, list your keys:

```bash
rollkit keys list --keyring-backend test
```

You should see an output like the following

```bash
- address: gm17rpwv7lnk96ka00v93rphhvcqqztpn896q0dxx
  name: alice
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A5WPM5WzfNIPrGyha/TlHt0okdlzS1O4Gb1d1kU+xuG+"}'
  type: local
- address: gm1r2udsh4za7r7sxvzy496qfazvjp04j4zgytve3
  name: bob
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A+jOX/CWInFer2IkqgXGo0da9j7Ubq+e1LJWzTMDjwdt"}'
  type: local
```

For convenience we export two of our keys like this:

```bash
export KEY1=gm17rpwv7lnk96ka00v93rphhvcqqztpn896q0dxx
export KEY2=gm1r2udsh4za7r7sxvzy496qfazvjp04j4zgytve3
```

Now let's submit a transaction that sends coins from one account to another (don't worry about all the flags, for now, we just want to submit transaction from a high-level perspective):

```bash
rollkit tx bank send $KEY2 $KEY1 42069stake --keyring-backend test --chain-id gm --fees 5000stake
```

You'll be prompted to accept the transaction:

```bash
auth_info:
  fee:
    amount: []
    gas_limit: "200000"
    granter: ""
    payer: ""
  signer_infos: []
  tip: null
body:
  extension_options: []
  memo: ""
  messages:
  - '@type': /cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend
    amount:
    - amount: "42069"
      denom: stake
    from_address: gm1r2udsh4za7r7sxvzy496qfazvjp04j4zgytve3
    to_address: gm17rpwv7lnk96ka00v93rphhvcqqztpn896q0dxx
  non_critical_extension_options: []
  timeout_height: "0"
signatures: []
confirm transaction before signing and broadcasting [y/N]: // [!code focus]
```

Confirm and sign the transaction as prompted. now you see the transaction hash at the output:

```bash
//...

txhash: 677CAF6C80B85ACEF6F9EC7906FB3CB021322AAC78B015FA07D5112F2F824BFF
```

## ⚖️ Checking Balances {#balances}

Query balances after the transaction:

```bash
rollkit query bank balances $KEY1
```

The receiver’s balance should show an increase.

```bash
balances: // [!code focus]
- amount: "42069" // [!code focus]
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

For the sender’s balance:

```bash
rollkit query bank balances $KEY2
```

Output:

```bash
balances: // [!code focus]
- amount: "99957931" // [!code focus]
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

## 📦 GM world UI app

Now that you have an idea of how to interact with the rollup with the rollkit CLI, let's look at the user interface (UI) application aspect of connecting a wallet to a rollup. 

Connecting your wallet to your rollup is as straightforward as connecting to any other blockchain. It assumes you have the [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) wallet extension installed in your browser.

## 🔗 Connecting your wallet

Kurtosis spun up a UI app alongside your rollup already, so to connect your Keplr wallet to the application, simply open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

Click the "Connect Wallet" button on the page, and approve the connection request in the Keplr prompt.

Once authorized, your wallet address will be displayed, confirming that your wallet is successfully connected.

:::tip
If you run into any issues, make sure your Keplr wallet is updated and set to connect to your local environment.

## 🎉 Next steps

Congratulations! You've experienced connecting to a rollup from the user side — simple and straightforward. Now, you might consider exploring how to add more application logic to your rollup using the Cosmos SDK, as demonstrated in our Wordle App tutorial.
