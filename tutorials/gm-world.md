description: Build a sovereign rollup with Ignite CLI, Celestia and Rollkit locally and on a testnet
---

# GM World rollup

## ☀️ Introduction {#introduction}

In this tutorial, we will build a sovereign `gm-world` rollup using Rollkit
and Celestia’s data availability and consensus layer to submit Rollkit blocks.

This tutorial will cover setting up Ignite CLI,
building a Cosmos-SDK application-specific rollup blockchain,
and posting data to Celestia.
First, we will test on a local DA network and then we will deploy to a live
testnet.

The [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) is a framework for
building blockchain applications. The Cosmos Ecosystem uses
[Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go)
to allow blockchains to communicate with one another.

The development journey for your rollup will look something like this:

1. [Part One](#part-one): Run your rollup and post DA to a local devnet, and make sure everything works as expected
2. [Part Two](#part-two): Deploy the rollup, posting to a DA testnet. Confirm again that everything is functioning properly
3. Coming soon: Deploy your rollup to the DA layer's mainnet

::: tip
This tutorial will explore developing with Rollkit,
which is still in Alpha stage. If you run into bugs, please write a Github
[Issue ticket](https://github.com/rollkit/docs/issues/new)
or let us know in our [Telegram](https://t.me/rollkit).

## 🤔 What is GM? {#what-is-gm}

GM means good morning. It's GM o'clock somewhere, so there's never a bad time
to say GM, Gm, or gm. You can think of "GM" as the new version of
"hello world".

    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### 🏃 Install wget on macOS {#install-wget-mac}

wget is an Internet file retriever:

```bash
brew install wget
```

## Part One

This part of the tutorial will teach developers how to easily run a local data availability (DA) devnet on their own machine (or in the cloud).
**Running a local devnet for DA to test your rollup is the recommended first step before deploying to a testnet.**
This eliminates the need for testnet tokens and deploying to a testnet until you are ready.

::: warning
Part One of the tutorial has only been tested on an AMD machine running Ubuntu 22.10 x64.
:::

Whether you're a developer simply testing things on your laptop or using a virtual machine in the cloud,
this process can be done on any machine of your choosing. We tested out the Devnet section (Part One) on a machine with the following specs:

* Memory: 1 GB RAM
* CPU: Single Core AMD
* Disk: 25 GB SSD Storage
* OS: Ubuntu 22.10 x64

### 💻 Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) installed on your machine

### 🏠 Running local devnet with a Rollkit rollup {#running-local-devnet-rollup}

First, run the [`local-celestia-devnet`](https://github.com/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet) by running the following command:

```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -p 26657:26657 -p 26658:26658 -p 26659:26659 ghcr.io/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet:v0.11.0-rc8
```

When passing the `--rollkit.da_config` flag later in the tutorial,
it will require `auth_token` to be passed in. The auth token with
write permission is required to submit blobs and can be obtained
with the following command once your local-celestia-devnet is running:

```bash
docker exec $(docker ps -q)  celestia bridge --node.store /bridge  auth admin
```

This will give you the local-celestia-devnet bridge node auth token. This
assumes that there is only one container, otherwise you can pass the container
name.

We'll use the variable later on to start our rollup.

### 🔎 Query your balance {#query-your-balance}

Open a new terminal instance. Check the balance on your account that you'll be using to post blocks to the
local network, this will make sure you can post rollup blocks to your Celestia Devnet for DA & consensus.

First, set your auth token:

```bash
export CELESTIA_NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=$(docker exec $(docker ps -q)  celestia bridge --node.store /bridge  auth admin)
```

Next, check your balance:

```bash
docker exec $(docker ps -q) celestia rpc state Balance --auth $CELESTIA_NODE_AUTH_TOKEN
```
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
You will see something like this, denoting your balance in TIA x 10<sup>-6</sup>:
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "denom": "utia",
    "amount": "999995000000000"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### 🏗️ Building your sovereign rollup {#building-your-sovereign-rollup}

Now that you have a Celestia devnet running, we are ready to use Golang
to build and run our Cosmos-SDK blockchain.

The Ignite CLI comes with scaffolding commands to make development of
blockchains quicker by creating everything that is needed to start a new
Cosmos SDK blockchain.

Check your version:

```bash
ignite version
```

Open a new tab or window in your terminal and run this command to
scaffold your rollup. Scaffold the chain:

```bash
cd $HOME
ignite scaffold chain gm --address-prefix gm
```

::: tip
The `--address-prefix gm` flag will change the address prefix from `cosmos` to `gm`. Read more on the [Cosmos docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/basics/accounts.html).
:::

The response will look similar to below:

::: warning
Do not run `ignite chain serve` as we will build the chain later in the tutorial.
:::

```bash
jcs @ ~ % ignite scaffold chain gm --address-prefix gm

⭐️ Successfully created a new blockchain 'gm'. // [!code focus]
👉 Get started with the following commands: // [!code focus]

 % cd gm // [!code focus]
 % ignite chain serve

Documentation: https://docs.ignite.com
```

This command has created a Cosmos SDK blockchain in the `gm` directory. The
`gm` directory contains a fully functional blockchain. The following standard
Cosmos SDK [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules) have been
imported:

* `staking` - for delegated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism
* `bank` - for fungible token transfers between accounts
* `gov` - for on-chain governance
* `mint` - for minting new units of staking token
* `nft` - for creating, transferring, and updating NFTs
* and [more](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/architecture/adr-043-nft-module.html)

Change to the `gm` directory:

```bash
cd gm
```

You can learn more about the `gm` directory’s file structure [here](https://docs.ignite.com/v0.25.2/guide/hello#blockchain-directory-structure).
Most of our work in this tutorial will happen in the `x` directory.

### 🗞️ Install Rollkit {#install-rollkit}

To swap out CometBFT for Rollkit, run the following command
from inside the `gm` directory:

::: code-group

```bash [local-celestia-devnet]
go mod edit -replace github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk=github.com/rollkit/cosmos-sdk@v0.47.3-rollkit-v0.10.2-no-fraud-proofs
go mod edit -replace github.com/gogo/protobuf=github.com/regen-network/protobuf@v1.3.3-alpha.regen.1
go mod tidy
go mod download
```

```bash [Arabica Devnet]
go mod edit -replace github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk=github.com/rollkit/cosmos-sdk@v0.47.3-rollkit-v0.10.2-no-fraud-proofs
go mod edit -replace github.com/gogo/protobuf=github.com/regen-network/protobuf@v1.3.3-alpha.regen.1
go mod tidy
go mod download
```

:::

### ▶️ Start your rollup {#start-your-rollup}

Download the `init-local.sh` script to start the chain:

```bash
# From inside the `gm` directory
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollkit/docs/main/scripts/gm/init-local.sh
```

Next, you'll need to set the auth token in your terminal to be consumed by
your `init-local.sh` script.

In the terminal that you will run the script in, set the auth token for the
local-celestia-devnet. This is so that you can post data to the local DA.

Remember that the following command assumes that there is only one container,
otherwise you can pass the container name.

```bash
export AUTH_TOKEN=$(docker exec $(docker ps -q)  celestia bridge --node.store /bridge  auth admin)
```

Run the `init-local.sh` script:

```bash
bash init-local.sh
```

This will start your rollup, connected to the local Celestia devnet you have running.

Now let's explore a bit.

::: tip

If you are restarting your rollup, you'll need to clear the old
chain history and binary:

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/.gm
rm $HOME/go/bin/gmd
```

:::

#### 🔑 Keys {#keys}

List your keys:

```bash
gmd keys list --keyring-backend test
```

You should see an output like the following

```bash
- address: gm1sa3xvrkvwhktjppxzaayst7s7z4ar06rk37jq7 // [!code focus]
  name: gm-key-2 // [!code focus]
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AlXXb6Op8DdwCejeYkGWbF4G3pDLDO+rYiVWKPKuvYaz"}'
  type: local
- address: gm13nf52x452c527nycahthqq4y9phcmvat9nejl2 // [!code focus]
  name: gm-key // [!code focus]
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AwigPerY+eeC2WAabA6iW1AipAQora5Dwmo1SnMnjavt"}'
  type: local
```

#### 💸 Transactions {#transactions}

Now we can test sending a transaction from one of our keys to the other. We can do that with the following command:

```bash
gmd tx bank send [from_key_or_address] [to_address] [amount] [flags]
```

Set your keys as variables to make it easier to add the address:

```bash
export KEY1=gm1sa3xvrkvwhktjppxzaayst7s7z4ar06rk37jq7
export KEY2=gm13nf52x452c527nycahthqq4y9phcmvat9nejl2
```
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD051 -->
So using our information from the [keys](#keys) command, we can construct the transaction command like so to send 42069stake from one address to another:
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD051 -->

```bash
gmd tx bank send $KEY1 $KEY2 42069stake --keyring-backend test \
--node tcp://127.0.0.1:36657
```

::: tip
We're using the `--node [ip:port]` flag to point to port 36657, which is
the custom port we used in the `init-local.sh` script to avoid
clashing with 26657 on local-celestia-devnet. We set it here:

```bash
--rpc.laddr tcp://127.0.0.1:36657
```

:::

You'll be prompted to accept the transaction:

```bash
auth_info:
  fee:
    amount: []
    gas_limit: "200000"
    granter: ""
    payer: ""
  signer_infos: []
  tip: null
body:
  extension_options: []
  memo: ""
  messages:
  - '@type': /cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend
    amount:
    - amount: "42069"
      denom: stake
    from_address: gm1sa3xvrkvwhktjppxzaayst7s7z4ar06rk37jq7
    to_address: gm13nf52x452c527nycahthqq4y9phcmvat9nejl2
  non_critical_extension_options: []
  timeout_height: "0"
signatures: []
confirm transaction before signing and broadcasting [y/N]: // [!code focus]
```

Type `y` if you'd like to confirm and sign the transaction. Then, you'll see the confirmation:

```bash
code: 0
codespace: ""
data: ""
events: []
gas_used: "0"
gas_wanted: "0"
height: "0"
info: ""
logs: []
raw_log: '[]'
timestamp: ""
tx: null
txhash: 677CAF6C80B85ACEF6F9EC7906FB3CB021322AAC78B015FA07D5112F2F824BFF
```

#### ⚖️ Balances {#balances}

Then, query your balance:

```bash
gmd query bank balances $KEY2 --node tcp://127.0.0.1:36657
```

This is the key that received the balance, so it should have increased past the initial `STAKING_AMOUNT`:

```bash
balances: // [!code focus]
- amount: "10000000000000000000042069" // [!code focus]
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

The other key, should have decreased in balance:

```bash
gmd query bank balances $KEY1 --node tcp://127.0.0.1:36657
```

Response:

```bash
balances: // [!code focus]
- amount: "9999999999999999999957931" // [!code focus]
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

## Part Two

### 🛑 Stopping our local devnet rollup {#stop-your-local-devnet}

First, you will need to stop your current devnet version of the gm rollup.
Follow instructions to stop the container below.

Find the Container ID that is running by using the command:

```bash
docker ps
```

Then stop the container:

```bash
docker stop CONTAINER_ID_or_NAME
```

#### 🟢 Restarting your container {#restart-your-container}

Optionally, if you'd like to restart your container, you can use the `docker start` command followed by the container ID or name.

You can obtain the container ID or name of a stopped container using the `docker ps -a` command, which will list all containers (running and stopped) and their details. For example:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

This will give you an output similar to this:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                            COMMAND            CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                                                                         NAMES
d9af68de54e4   ghcr.io/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet:v0.9.1   "/entrypoint.sh"   5 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   1317/tcp, 9090/tcp, 0.0.0.0:26657->26657/tcp, :::26657->26657/tcp, 26656/tcp, 0.0.0.0:26659->26659/tcp, :::26659->26659/tcp   musing_matsumoto
```

In this example, you can restart the container using either its container ID (`d9af68de54e4`) or name (`musing_matsumoto`). To restart the container, run:

```bash
docker start d9af68de54e4
```

or

```bash
docker start musing_matsumoto
```

#### 🗑️ Removing your container {#removing-your-container}

If you ever would like to remove the container, you can use the `docker rm` command followed by the container ID or name.

Here is an example:

```bash
docker rm CONTAINER_ID_or_NAME
```

### 🪶 Run a Celestia light node {#run-celestia-node}

Follow instructions to install and start your Celestia data availability
layer light node selecting the Arabica network. You can
find instructions to install and run the node [here](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/light-node).

After you have Go and Ignite CLI installed, and your Celestia Light
Node running on your machine, you're ready to build, test, and launch your own
sovereign rollup.

An example start command on `arabica-9` would look like this:

```bash
celestia light start --core.ip consensus-full-arabica-9.celestia-arabica.com --p2p.network arabica
```

### 💬 Say gm world {#say-gm-world}

Now, we're going to get our blockchain to say `gm world!` - in order to do so
you need to make the following changes:

* Modify a protocol buffer file
* Create a keeper query function that returns data

Protocol buffer files contain proto RPC calls that define Cosmos SDK queries
and message handlers, and proto messages that define Cosmos SDK types. The RPC
calls are also responsible for exposing an HTTP API.

The `Keeper` is required for each Cosmos SDK module and is an abstraction for
modifying the state of the blockchain. Keeper functions allow us to query or
write to the state.

#### ✋ Create your first query {#create-first-query}

**Open a new terminal instance that is not the
same that you started the chain in.**

In your new terminal, `cd` into the `gm` directory and run this command
to create the `gm` query:

```bash
ignite scaffold query gm --response text
```

Response:

```bash
modify proto/gm/gm/query.proto
modify x/gm/client/cli/query.go
create x/gm/client/cli/query_gm.go
create x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go

🎉 Created a query `gm`.
```

What just happened? `query` accepts the name of the query (`gm`), an optional
list of request parameters (empty in this tutorial), and an optional
comma-separated list of response field with a `--response` flag (`text` in this

Navigate to the `gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto` file, you’ll see that `Gm` RPC has
been added to the `Query` service:

```proto title="gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto"
service Query {
  rpc Params(QueryParamsRequest) returns (QueryParamsResponse) {
    option (google.api.http).get = "/gm/gm/params";
  }
 rpc Gm(QueryGmRequest) returns (QueryGmResponse) {
  option (google.api.http).get = "/gm/gm/gm";
 }
}
```

The `Gm` RPC for the `Query` service:

* is responsible for returning a `text` string
* Accepts request parameters (`QueryGmRequest`)
* Returns response of type `QueryGmResponse`
* The `option` defines the endpoint that is used by gRPC to generate an HTTP API

#### 📨 Query request and response types {#query-request-and-response-types}

In the same file, we will find:

* `QueryGmRequest` is empty because it does not require parameters
* `QueryGmResponse` contains `text` that is returned from the chain

```proto title="gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto"
message QueryGmRequest {
}

message QueryGmResponse {
  string text = 1;
}
```

#### 👋 Gm keeper function {#gm-keeper-function}

The `gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go` file contains the `Gm` keeper function that
handles the query and returns data.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->
```go title="gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go"
func (k Keeper) Gm(goCtx context.Context, req *types.QueryGmRequest) (*types.QueryGmResponse, error) {
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	_ = ctx
	return &types.QueryGmResponse{}, nil
}
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD010 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The `Gm` function performs the following actions:

* Makes a basic check on the request and throws an error if it’s `nil`
* Stores context in a `ctx` variable that contains information about the
environment of the request
* Returns a response of type `QueryGmResponse`

Currently, the response is empty and you'll need to update the keeper function.

Our `query.proto` file defines that the response accepts `text`. Use your text
editor to modify the keeper function in `gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go` .

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->
```go title="gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go"
func (k Keeper) Gm(goCtx context.Context, req *types.QueryGmRequest) (*types.QueryGmResponse, error) {
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	_ = ctx
	return &types.QueryGmResponse{Text: "gm world!"}, nil // [!code focus]
}
```

#### 🟢 Start your sovereign rollup {#start-your-sovereign-rollup}

We have a handy `init-testnet.sh` found in this repo
[here](https://github.com/rollkit/docs/tree/main/scripts/gm).

We can copy it over to our directory with the following commands:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```bash
# From inside the `gm` directory
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollkit/docs/main/scripts/gm/init-testnet.sh
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

This copies over our `init-testnet.sh` script to initialize our
`gm` rollup.

You can view the contents of the script to see how we
initialize the gm rollup.

##### Clear previous chain history

Before starting the rollup, we need to remove the old project folders:

```bash
rm -r $HOME/go/bin/gmd && rm -rf $HOME/.gm
```

##### Set the auth token for your light node

You will also need to set the auth token for your Celestia light node
before running the rollup. In the terminal that you will run the
`init-testnet.sh` script in, run the following:

```bash
export AUTH_TOKEN=$(celestia light auth admin --p2p.network arabica)
```

##### Start the new chain {#start-the-new-chain}

Now, you can initialize the script with the following command:

```bash
bash init-testnet.sh
```

With that, we have kickstarted our second `gmd` network!

The `query` command has also scaffolded
`x/gm/client/cli/query_gm.go` that
implements a CLI equivalent of the gm query and mounted this command in
`x/gm/client/cli/query.go`.

In a separate window, run the following command:

```bash
gmd q gm gm
```

We will get the following JSON response:

```bash
text: gm world!
```
