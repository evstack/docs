# Deploying Your Rollup

One of the benefits of building rollups with Rollkit is the flexibility you have as a developer to choose things like the DA layer, the settlement scheme, and the execution environment.

The challenge that comes with this flexibility is that there are more services that now need to be deployed and managed while running your rollup.

In the tutorials so far, you've seen various helper scripts used to make things easier. While great for tutorials, there are better ways to deploy and manage rollups than using various bash scripts.

In this section, you'll see a few examples of how you can deploy your rollup environment with all your services running in a more production-ready way.

:::warning Disclaimer
These examples are for educational purposes only. Before deploying your rollup for production use you should fully understand the services you are deploying and your choice in deployment method.
