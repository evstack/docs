# Polaris EVM and Rollkit

::: danger
We regret to inform that Polaris V1 and Rollkit integration is not fully functional. Current issues are tracked in https://github.com/rollkit/rollkit/issues/1594. We are expecting Polaris V2 release soon and Rollkit support will be added along with update tutorial. 
:::

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for running the
[Polaris EVM](https://github.com/berachain/polaris)
using Rollkit. Polaris EVM is a version of the
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that is designed to run
the [Berachain](https://berachain.com) network.
This version has been modified to use Celestia as a data availability
layer. This integration uses a local-celestia-devnet. Rollkit
is used to deploy a Polaris EVM rollup without needing to set up a data
availability and consensus network.

::: tip
Learn how to [restart your rollup](restart-rollup.md).
:::

## Prerequisites

Before you can run Polaris EVM using Rollkit, you need to have the
following software installed on your machine:

* Docker running on your machine
* Go version >= 1.21.0

## Run a local-celestia-devnet

Before you can start Polaris EVM, you need to start a
local-celestia-devnet instance in a separate terminal:

```bash
docker run -t -i --platform linux/amd64 -p 26650:26650 -p 26657:26657 -p 26658:26658 -p 26659:26659 -p 9090:9090 ghcr.io/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet:v0.12.6
```

## Clone the repo

To get started, clone the Polaris repository and switch to the Rollkit branch:

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/berachain/polaris.git
cd polaris && git checkout rollkit
```

## Install Foundry

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

## Start the Polaris EVM using Rollkit

Then start the chain in your first terminal:

```bash
cd $HOME/polaris && foundryup
make start
```

## Congratulations

You now have a Polaris EVM Rollkit rollup running! The rollup logs will begin to look similar to this:

```bash

```

## Funds

The following private key has funds on your Polaris chain:

```bash
Address: 0x20f33CE90A13a4b5E7697E3544c3083B8F8A51D4
PrivateKey: 0xfffdbb37105441e14b0ee6330d855d8504ff39e705c3afa8f859ac9865f99306
```

Just deploy a smart contract to get started! If you'd like to learn
how to deploy your own [GM Portal](https://gmportal.xyz) (as an ooga booga portal) you
can follow the [remainder](#frontend) of this tutorial.

## Frontend

Now we will make a frontend with a smart contract on our Polaris
EVM rollup. First, clone the GM Portal repository and check out to the Polaris branch (ooga booga portal):

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/jcstein/gm-portal.git
cd gm-portal && git checkout polaris
```

### Deploy the ooga booga portal contract

Next, you will deploy the smart contract.
Export the funded private key and RPC URL:

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0xfffdbb37105441e14b0ee6330d855d8504ff39e705c3afa8f859ac9865f99306
export RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
```

Use Foundry to deploy the contract to your EVM:

```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/GmPortal.s.sol:GmPortalScript --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

A successful deployment's output will look similar to:

```bash
forge script script/GmPortal.s.sol:GmPortalScript --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
[â ’] Compiling...
[â ‘] Compiling 18 files with 0.8.20
[â ˜] Solc 0.8.20 finished in 1.52s
Compiler run successful!
Script ran successfully.

```

From the contract deployment output, export your contract address:

```bash
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x18Df82C7E422A42D47345Ed86B0E935E9718eBda
```

### Interact with the contract

Send an "ooga booga" to the contract:

```bash
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
"gm(string)" "ooga booga" \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

Get total (hex-encoded) GMs (ooga boogas):

```bash
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getTotalGms()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

### Start and update the frontend

Now, change into the frontend directory:

```bash
cd $HOME/gm-portal/frontend
yarn && yarn dev
```

![polaris-evm](/polaris-evm/polaris-start-site.png)

Now, your frontend is running! We'll display and interact with our smart contract
on our frontend.

First, you will need to change the contract address on  `gm-portal/frontend/src/App.tsx` to your contract address from above before you can interact with the contract on the frontend:

::: tip
**Only if you changed the contract**, you will need to update the ABI in `gm-portal/frontend/GmPortal.json` from `gm-portal/contracts/out/GmPortal.sol/GmPortal.json`. This can be done with:

```bash
cd $HOME
cp gm-portal/contracts/out/GmPortal.sol/GmPortal.json gm-portal/frontend
```

:::

### Interact with the frontend

In order to interact with the contract on the frontend, you'll need to fund an account that you have in your Ethereum wallet
or add the private key from above into your wallet.

To transfer to an external account, use this command:

```bash
export RECEIVER=<receiver ETH address>
cast send --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY $RECEIVER --value 1ether --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

_If you are in a different terminal than the one you set the private key in originally,
you may need to set it again._

Now, login with your wallet that you funded, and post a ooga booga on your ooga booga portal!

## Running Polaris EVM with a Celestia light node

In this portion of the tutorial, we will go over running Polaris x Rollkit using
a Celestia light node to post data to Mocha testnet. These steps can be used for
Mainnet Beta and Arabica devnet, too, you'll just need to change the network in the
`--p2p.network string` flag and your RPC.

::: tip
Before using RPC methods through the CLI, you'll need to set your
[auth token](https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/#auth-token-).
:::

In order to successfully **post and retrieve** data to and from Celestia's
Mocha testnet, your light node will need to be fully synced. You can check
the status by using the
[`das.SamplingStats` method](https://docs.celestia.org/api/v0.11.0-rc13/#daser.SamplingStats) using
[the CLI](https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/#get-data-availability-sampler-stats).

Your node will also need to be funded with testnet TIA, which you
can obtain by
[retrieving your account address](https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/#get-your-account-address)
and visiting a [faucet](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/arabica-devnet/#arabica-devnet-faucet).

### Start your light node

1. Fully sync and fund a light node on
[Celestia's Mocha testnet](docs.celestia.org/nodes/mocha-testnet)
(`mocha-4`). Follow instructions to install and start your Celestia
data availability layer light node selecting the Mocha network. You can
[find instructions to install and run the node](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/light-node).
After the node is synced, stop the light node.

2. Use
[`celestia-da`](https://github.com/rollkit/celestia-da)
to connect to Rollkit. Your node does not need to be running
when you start `celestia-da`. To start `celestia-da` and your light node, run this command:

:::tip
You can either use the default `000000506f6c61726973`
namespace below, or set your own by using a command
similar to this to generate one (or, you could get creative ðŸ˜Ž):

```bash
openssl rand -hex 10
```

[Learn more about namespaces](https://celestiaorg.github.io/celestia-app/specs/namespace.html)
.
:::

```bash
docker run -d \
-e NODE_TYPE=light \
-e P2P_NETWORK=mocha \
-p 26650:26650 \
-p 26658:26658 \
-p 26659:26659 \
-v $HOME/.celestia-light-mocha-4/:/home/celestia/.celestia-light-mocha-4/ \
ghcr.io/rollkit/celestia-da:v0.12.10 \
celestia-da light start \
--p2p.network=mocha \
--da.grpc.namespace=000000506f6c61726973 \
--da.grpc.listen=0.0.0.0:26650 \
--core.ip rpc-mocha.pops.one \
--gateway
```

### Setup Polaris script

First, ensure you're on the correct branch of Polaris:

```bash
cd $HOME/polaris && git checkout rollkit
```

Before starting your rollup, you'll want to make a change in
`$HOME/polaris/e2e/testapp/entrypoint.sh` to point to the right
DA start height:

```bash
# set the data availability layer's block height from local-celestia-devnet
DA_BLOCK_HEIGHT=$(docker exec $(docker ps -q) celestia header local-head --token $AUTH_TOKEN | jq '.result.header.height' -r) // [!code --]
DA_BLOCK_HEIGHT=$(curl https://rpc-mocha.pops.one/block |jq -r '.result.block.header.height') // [!code ++]
```

### Start the EVM rollup

Change into the Polaris directory in your terminal:

```bash
cd $HOME/polaris
make start
```

Congratulations! Your light node is now posting your rollup's data to
Celestia's Mocha testnet.

Find an explorer to view
[the default namespace in the tutorial](https://mocha-4.celenium.io/namespace/000000000000000000000000000000000000000000506f6c61726973)
or [search for your own namespace on Celenium](https://celenium.io).
