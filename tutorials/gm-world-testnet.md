## Deploying to a Celestia testnet

This tutorial is part two of the GM world rollup tutorials. In this tutorial,
it is expected that you've completed [part one](./gm-world.md) of
the tutorial and are familiar with running a local rollup devnet.

### ü™∂¬†Run a Celestia light node {#run-celestia-node}

Follow instructions to install and start your Celestia data availability
layer light node selecting the Arabica network. You can
find instructions to install and run the node [here](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/light-node).

After you have Go and Ignite CLI installed, and your Celestia Light
Node running on your machine, you're ready to build, test, and launch your own
sovereign rollup.

An example start command on `arabica-9` would look like this:

```bash
celestia light start --core.ip consensus-full-arabica-9.celestia-arabica.com --p2p.network arabica
```

### üí¨¬†Say gm world {#say-gm-world}

Now, we're going to get our blockchain to say `gm world!` - in order to do so
you need to make the following changes:

* Modify a protocol buffer file
* Create a keeper query function that returns data

Protocol buffer files contain proto RPC calls that define Cosmos SDK queries
and message handlers, and proto messages that define Cosmos SDK types. The RPC
calls are also responsible for exposing an HTTP API.

The `Keeper` is required for each Cosmos SDK module and is an abstraction for
modifying the state of the blockchain. Keeper functions allow us to query or
write to the state.

#### ‚úã¬†Create your first query {#create-first-query}

**Open a new terminal instance that is not the
same that you started the chain in.**

In your new terminal, `cd` into the `gm` directory and run this command
to create the `gm` query:

```bash
ignite scaffold query gm --response text
```

Response:

```bash
modify proto/gm/gm/query.proto
modify x/gm/client/cli/query.go
create x/gm/client/cli/query_gm.go
create x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go

üéâ Created a query `gm`.
```

What just happened? `query` accepts the name of the query (`gm`), an optional
list of request parameters (empty in this tutorial), and an optional
comma-separated list of response field with a `--response` flag (`text` in this
tutorial).

Navigate to the `gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto` file, you‚Äôll see that `Gm` RPC has
been added to the `Query` service:

```proto title="gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto"
service Query {
  rpc Params(QueryParamsRequest) returns (QueryParamsResponse) {
    option (google.api.http).get = "/gm/gm/params";
  }
 rpc Gm(QueryGmRequest) returns (QueryGmResponse) {
  option (google.api.http).get = "/gm/gm/gm";
 }
}
```

The `Gm` RPC for the `Query` service:

* is responsible for returning a `text` string
* Accepts request parameters (`QueryGmRequest`)
* Returns response of type `QueryGmResponse`
* The `option` defines the endpoint that is used by gRPC to generate an HTTP API

#### üì®¬†Query request and response types {#query-request-and-response-types}

In the same file, we will find:

* `QueryGmRequest` is empty because it does not require parameters
* `QueryGmResponse` contains `text` that is returned from the chain

```proto title="gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto"
message QueryGmRequest {
}

message QueryGmResponse {
  string text = 1;
}
```

#### üëã¬†Gm keeper function {#gm-keeper-function}

The `gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go` file contains the `Gm` keeper function that
handles the query and returns data.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->
```go title="gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go"
func (k Keeper) Gm(goCtx context.Context, req *types.QueryGmRequest) (*types.QueryGmResponse, error) {
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	_ = ctx
	return &types.QueryGmResponse{}, nil
}
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD010 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The `Gm` function performs the following actions:

* Makes a basic check on the request and throws an error if it‚Äôs `nil`
* Stores context in a `ctx` variable that contains information about the
environment of the request
* Returns a response of type `QueryGmResponse`

Currently, the response is empty and you'll need to update the keeper function.

Our `query.proto` file defines that the response accepts `text`. Use your text
editor to modify the keeper function in `gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go` .

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->
```go title="gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go"
func (k Keeper) Gm(goCtx context.Context, req *types.QueryGmRequest) (*types.QueryGmResponse, error) {
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	_ = ctx
	return &types.QueryGmResponse{Text: "gm world!"}, nil // [!code focus]
}
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD010 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

#### üü¢¬†Start your sovereign rollup {#start-your-sovereign-rollup}

We have a handy `init-testnet.sh` found in this repo
[here](https://github.com/rollkit/docs/tree/main/scripts/gm).

We can copy it over to our directory with the following commands:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```bash
# From inside the `gm` directory
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollkit/docs/main/scripts/gm/init-testnet.sh
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

This copies over our `init-testnet.sh` script to initialize our
`gm` rollup.

You can view the contents of the script to see how we
initialize the gm rollup.

##### Clear previous chain history

Before starting the rollup, we need to remove the old project folders:

```bash
rm -r $HOME/go/bin/gmd && rm -rf $HOME/.gm
```

##### Set the auth token for your light node

You will also need to set the auth token for your Celestia light node
before running the rollup. In the terminal that you will run the
`init-testnet.sh` script in, run the following:

```bash
export AUTH_TOKEN=$(celestia light auth admin --p2p.network arabica)
```

##### Start the new chain {#start-the-new-chain}

Now, you can initialize the script with the following command:

```bash
bash init-testnet.sh
```

With that, we have kickstarted our second `gmd` network!

The¬†`query`¬†command has also scaffolded
`x/gm/client/cli/query_gm.go`¬†that
implements a CLI equivalent of the gm query and mounted this command in
`x/gm/client/cli/query.go`.

In a separate window, run the following command:

```bash
gmd q gm gm
```

We will get the following JSON response:

```bash
text: gm world!
```

Congratulations üéâ you've successfully built your first rollup and queried it!
