# zkML Rollup Tutorial with Sindri

## Introduction - Code Once, Verify Anywhere

This guide will show you how to build verifiable machine learning inference into your Rollkit rollup using zero-knowledge proofs generated on [Sindri](https://sindri.app).
The rollup will rely on a local Celestia devnet for consensus and ensuring data availability.

We will focus on using a ZK circuit that incorporates a compact deep neural network model to enable verifiable ML inference.
In this guide, we will deploy the circuit on Sindri, obtain a smart contract verifier (automatically generated by Sindri) for that circuit, deploy it on Rollkit, create a proof of ML inference on Sindri, and verify the proof on-chain.

This approach not only secures the verification process of machine learning models, but also leverages the decentralized security and scalability of Celestia's architecture.

## Prerequisites

- An operational [Polaris EVM](/tutorials/polaris-evm.md) using Rollkit (see next step)
- A [Sindri](https://sindri.app) API key, which can be obtained [here](https://hen4zp9gxq3.typeform.com/to/hJHlUF8c?typeform-source=sindri.app)
- Python 3.10+ installed as well as the [Sindri Python SDK](https://sindri.app/docs/reference/sdk/python/) (more information below)

### Setting Up the Polaris EVM using Rollkit

This walkthrough assumes you started the Polaris EVM using Rollkit and should be interpreted as a direct continuation of this [Polaris EVM and Rollkit guide](https://rollkit.dev/tutorials/polaris-evm).

### Installing the Sindri Python SDK

Because we're working with ML, we're going to build with Sindri's Python SDK because Python is widely used in ML development.
The [Sindri Python SDK Quickstart Guide](https://sindri.app/docs/getting-started/api-sdk/#python-sdk) contains installation instructions and a high-level walkthrough of the functionality of this package, but the following will suffice if you have `pip` installed:

```bash
pip install sindri
```

## Deploying and Proving a Cool zkML Circuit to Sindri

For this tutorial, we'll be working with a pre-built zkML circuit built by Sindri.
_For a more in-depth description of this circuit and its corresponding ML model's behavior and design, please see [here](https://github.com/Sindri-Labs/sindri-resources/tree/main/circuit_tutorials/circom/food_ml/README.md)._

### Clone

Clone the [Sindri Resources](https://github.com/Sindri-Labs/sindri-resources/tree/main) GitHub repo.

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/Sindri-Labs/sindri-resources.git
```

Navigate to the `food_ml` circuit tutorial directory.

```bash
cd sindri-resources/circuit_tutorials/circom/food_ml/
```

Here, you will find a handful of files.
The `circuit/` directory contains the circuit code that we will upload to Sindri.
The `circuit/sindri.json` file is the Sindri manifest for your upload.
Within it, you can modify the circuit's `"name"` value to whatever you like.

### Modify

Open the `compile_and_prove.py` script and append the following lines to the very bottom.

```python
# Obtain smart contract verifier for our circuit and save it to a file
smart_contract_code: str = sindri.get_circuit_smart_contract_verifier(circuit_id)
verifier_code_file: str = "Verifier.sol"
with open(verifier_code_file, "w") as f:
    f.write(smart_contract_code)
print(f"Smart contract verifier code written to {verifier_code_file}\n")

# Obtain our proof's proof+public formatted as calldata for our circuit's
# smart contract verifier
proof = sindri.get_proof(proof_id, include_smart_contract_calldata=True)
calldata_file: str = "calldata.txt"
calldata: str  = proof["smart_contract_calldata"]

# Fix formatting so it works with Rollkit
import json
a = json.loads("["+calldata_str+"]")
calldata_objects = []
for i in a:
    calldata_objects.append(json.dumps(i).replace("\"", "").replace(" ",""))
rollkit_calldata_str = " ".join(calldata_objects)

# Save calldata to file
with open(calldata_file, "w") as f:
    f.write(rollkit_calldata_str)
print(f"Proof calldata written to {calldata_file}\n")
```

These additions will allow us to fetch and save the following to files:

- the circuit's smart contract verifier code that is generated by Sindri when we deployed our circuit
- the proof's proof+public formatted as calldata to run with the smart contract verifier _on Rollkit_

### Deploy and Prove your zkML Circuit on Sindri

Export your Sindri API Key to an environment variable (or prepend it to the run command in the next step).

```bash
export SINDRI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Run the `compile_and_prove.py` script.
This will upload the `circuit/` directory to Sindri, where Sindri will compile and host your circuit.
Then, it will run a single proof for the circuit.
Finally, it will save the circuit's smart contract verifier code that is generated by Sindri to the `Verifier.sol` file and it will save the proof's proof+public formatted as `calldata` for that smart contract to `calldata.txt`.

```bash
python3 compile_and_prove.py
```

Congratulations!
You just deployed a zkML circuit to Sindri and proved it on Sindri's production-quality infrastructure with built-in, custom GPU-accelerated proving techniques.
Furthermore, you now have smart contract verifier code (and some calldata) for verifying proofs of that circuit on-chain.

## Deploy Smart Contract Verifier to Rollkit

Next, we will deploy this smart contract to Rollkit and verify our zkML proof on-chain.
_This section assumes you have an operational Rollkit instance of Polaris EVM running and your `gm-portal/` directory is located in the `$HOME` directory on your machine._

### Deploy

Copy your new `Verifier.sol` smart contract to the `~/gm-portal/contracts/src/.` directory in your Polaris EVM.

```bash
cd $HOME
cp sindri-resources/circuit_tutorials/circom/food_ml/Verifier.sol gm-portal/contracts/src/Verifier.sol
```

Next, let's make a copy of the example `~/gm-portal/contracts/script/GmPortal.s.sol` and modify it to reference your new `Verifier.sol` contract.

```bash
cd gm-portal/contracts/script/
cp GmPortal.s.sol Verifier.s.sol
```

Open up the new `Verifier.s.sol` and modify it to interact with your new `Verifier.sol` instead of the example `GmPortal.sol`.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";

import {Verifier} from "src/Verifier.sol";

contract VerifierScript is Script {
    function setUp() public {}

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        new Verifier();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

Then, deploy the contract to your Rollkit environment.
_Your `PRIVATE_KEY` and `RPC_URL` are for your Rollkit Polaris EVM._

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=0xfffdbb37105441e14b0ee6330d855d8504ff39e705c3afa8f859ac9865f99306
export RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
```

```bash
cd ..
forge script script/Verifier.s.sol:VerifierScript --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

A successful deployment's output will look similar to the following.

```
forge script script/Verifier.s.sol:VerifierScript --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast

From your contract deployment output, **export your contract address**: `Contract Address: 0x5C59C83c099F72FcE832208f96a23a1E43737a14`. _Note that the address will be different._

```bash
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x5C59C83c099F72FcE832208f96a23a1E43737a14
```

## Interact with the Contract - Verify your zkML Proof On-Chain

Now, we will send your zkML circuit's proof to the contract and verify it on-chain.
Keep in mind that your verifier contract can be used across any EVM-compatible environment.
Thus, we can compare the cost of execution across multiple environments.

First, grab the contents of your proof calldata and save it in a variable.

```bash
CALLDATA=$(cat $HOME/sindri-resources/circuit_tutorials/circom/food_ml/calldata.txt)
```

Then, interact with the smart contract using the calldata.

```bash
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
"verifyProof(uint256[2],uint256[2][2],uint256[2],uint256[1])" \
$CALLDATA \
--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

The output will look like the following.

```bash
cast send $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "verifyProof(uint256[2],uint256[2][2],uint256[2],uint256[1])" $CALLDATA --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL

## Congratulations

Congratulations, you've just verified a zkML circuit on Rollkit.

For further reading, check out [Sindri's blog post](https://sindri.app/blog/2024/02/21/zkml-modularity/) explaining how using Sindri + Rollkit x Celestia means verifiable ML doesn’t have to be prohibitively expensive for operators or end users.
