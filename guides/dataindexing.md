# Data Indexing

Onchain data indexing is a critical component of a thriving ecosystem, enabling developers to retrieve a read copy and query data from a given rollup. Ormi Labs offers a suite of indexing solutions, ranging from Subgraph hosting to a robust SQL engine. Coming soon, Ormi will provide the ability to deploy custom indexing environments for your rollup via the Rollkit CLI, eliminating the need to directly request network support from data providers.

In the meantime, the Ormi team is collaborating with rollups on an ad hoc basis to develop these environments, along with additional indexing and analytics solutions.
If your rollup requires a more customized enterprise solution, please fill out this [form](https://vrrgtxu2ujv.typeform.com/ormilabs) with your requirements, and the Ormi team will reach out.

This document will be continuously updated with more information and tutorials on integrating Ormiâ€™s onchain data indexing solutions for your rollup.
