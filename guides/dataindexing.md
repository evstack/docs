# Data Indexing

Onchain data indexing is a critical component of a thriving ecosystem, enabling developers to retrieve and query data from a given rollup.

Ormi Labs offers a suite of indexing solutions, including Subgraph hosting, a robust SQL engine, and custom APIs. Coming soon, Ormi will provide the ability to deploy custom indexing environments for your rollup via the Rollkit CLI, eliminating the need to directly request network support from data providers.

In the meantime, the Ormi team is working with rollups on an ad hoc basis to build these environments. 

If your rollup requires a more customized enterprise solution, please fill out this [form](https://vrrgtxu2ujv.typeform.com/ormilabs) with your requirements, and the Ormi team will reach out.
