# The Rollkit Stack

This section will cover the dependencies and customizeable components of Rollkit.

Roll-up sequencer nodes collect transactions from users, aggregate them into blocks, and post the blocks onto Celestia (or other DA layer) to be ordered and finalized. Full nodes execute and verify roll-up blocks, and propagate fraud-proofs when needed. Light clients receive headers, verify fraud proofs, and can authenticate trust-minimized queries about the state.

For an understanding of the Rollkit stack, let's first look at the key components of a rollup. A typical rollup has:

## Rollup Application Dependencies

Would you like to change your Cosmos-SDK application to a Rollkit rollup?
No problem! You need to replace the Cosmos-SDK Go dependency with
Rollkit-enabled version, which can be found
here: [https://github.com/rollkit/cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/rollkit/cosmos-sdk).

To note, the [`rollkit/cosmos-sdk`](https://github.com/rollkit/cosmos-sdk) repository follows the release branches of
upstream Cosmos-SDK, but with the bonus of using Rollkit instead of Tendermint
as the ABCI client.

And don't forget to replace another dependency, `tendermint`, with
[`rollkit/tendermint`](https://github.com/rollkit/tendermint), which has an enhanced ABCI interface that includes
the methods needed for state fraud proofs.

> **Requires Golang version 1.19+**

## Mempool

<!-- Drafting: a mempool for queing up transactions - Manav -->

The mempool keeps the set of pending transactions, and is used by block
producers to produce blocks and full nodes to verify blocks. Currently, transactions are handled by
nodes in the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) manner. Ordering of transactions
can be implemented on the application level (for example by adding
nonce/sequence number). This behavior is similar to the Tendermint mempool.

We plan to make transaction ordering in blocks configurable in the future.

## State Fraud Proofs

<!-- Drafting: Manav -->

## P2P-Layer

Rollkit's P2P layer enables direct communication between rollup nodes.
It's used to gossip transactions, headers of newly created blocks and state fraud proofs.
The P2P layer is implemented using [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p).

Rollkit uses [DHT-based active peer discovery](https://curriculum.pl-launchpad.io/curriculum/libp2p/dht/).
Starting a node connects to preconfigured bootstrap peers, and advertises it's namespace ID in DHT.
This solution is flexible, because multiple rollup networks may reuse the same DHT/bootstrap nodes,
but specific rollup network might decide to use dedicated nodes as well.

## DA-Access

Data Availability (DA) can be accessed using generic [interfaces](https://github.com/rollkit/rollkit/blob/main/da/da.go). This design allows for seamless integration with any DA.

The `DataAvailabilityLayerClient` interface includes essential life-cycle methods (`Init`, `Start`, `Stop`) as well as data-availability methods (`SubmitBlock`, `CheckBlockAvailability`).

The `BlockRetriever` interface serves to enable syncing of full nodes from the Data Availability layer.
It's important to keep in mind that there is no direct correlation between the DA block height and the rollup height. Each DA block may contain an arbitrary number of rollup blocks.

## Rollkit Node Types

### Sequencer node

Some roll-ups utilize _sequencer nodes_. Sequencers are the main block producers for rollups, respoonsible for aggregating transactions into blocks, and typically executing transactions to produce a state root, securing the rollup's light clients.

Rollkit plans to support multiple different pluggable sequencer schemes:

|                                | Deploy in one-click                  | Faster soft-confirmations than L1 | Control over rollup's transaction ordering | Atomic Composability with other Rollups | Censorship resistance | Implementation Status |

### Full node

Full nodes verify all blocks and can produce fraud proofs for optimistic rollups. Since they fully validate all rollup blocks, they don't rely on fraud or validity proofs for security.

### Light node

Light nodes are light-weight rollup nodes that authenticate block headers, and are secured by fraud proofs or validity proofs. They're recommended for average users on low-resource devices. Users running light nodes can make trust-minimized queries about the rollup's state.

## Block-Manager

The Block Manager contains go routines, `AggregationLoop`, `RetrieveLoop`, `SyncLoop` that communicate through go channels. These go routines are run when a Rollkit Node starts up (`OnStart`). Only the Sequencer Nodes run `AggregatonLoop` which controls the frequency of block production for a roll-up with a timer as per the `BlockTime` in `BlockManager`.

All nodes run `SyncLoop` which looks for the following operations:

- **Receive block headers**: Block headers are received through a channel `HeaderInCh` and Rollkit Nodes attempt to verify the block with the corresponding block data.
- **Receive block data**: Block bodies are received through a channel `blockInCh` and Rollkit Nodes attempt to verify the block.
- **Receive State Fraud Proofs**: State Fraud Proofs are received through a channel `FraudProofInCh` and Rollkit Notes attempt to verify them. Note that we plan to make this configurable for Full Nodes since Full Nodes also produce State Fraud Proofs on their own.
- Signal `RetrieveLoop` with timer as per the `DABlockTime` in `BlockManager`.

All nodes also run `RetrieveLoop` which is responsible for interacting with the Data Availability layer. It checks the last updated `DAHeight` to retrieve a block with timer `DABlockTime` signaled by `SyncLoop`. Note that the start height of the DA layer for the roll-up, `DAStartHeight`, is configurable in `BlockManager`.
