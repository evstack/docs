# GM world rollup

:::tip difficulty
Beginner
:::

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Introduction

In this tutorial, we will build a sovereign `gm world` rollup using Rollkit
and Celestia‚Äôs data availability and consensus layer to submit Rollkit blocks.

This tutorial will cover setting up a Celestia Light Node, Ignite CLI, and
building a Cosmos-SDK application-specific rollup blockchain on top of
Celestia.

The [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) is a framework for
building blockchain applications. The Cosmos Ecosystem uses
[Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go)
to allow blockchains to communicate with one another.

:::tip note
This tutorial will explore developing with Rollkit,
which is still in Alpha stage. If you run into bugs, please write a Github
[Issue ticket](https://github.com/rollkit/docs/issues/new)
or let us know in our [Telegram](https://t.me/rollkit).
:::

:::danger caution
The script for this tutorial is built for Celestia's
[Blockspacerace testnet](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/blockspace-race).
If you choose to use Mocha testnet or Arabica devnet,
you will need to modify the script manually.

### ü§î What is GM?

GM means good morning. It's GM o'clock somewhere, so there's never a bad time
to say GM, Gm, or gm. You can think of "GM" as the new version of
"hello world".

## ü™∂¬†Run a Celestia light node

Follow instructions to install and start your Celestia Data Availalbility
layer Light Node selecting the network that you had previously used. You can
find instructions to install and run the node [here](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/light-node).

After you have Go and Ignite CLI installed, and your Celestia Light
Node running on your machine, you're ready to build, test, and launch your own
sovereign rollup.

## üóû¬†Building a sovereign rollup

The Ignite CLI comes with scaffolding commands to make development of
blockchains quicker by creating everything that is needed to start a new
Cosmos SDK blockchain.

Open a new tab or window in your terminal and run this command to scaffold your rollup:

```bash
ignite scaffold chain gm
```

The response will look similar to below:

```bash
jcs @ ~ % ignite scaffold chain gm

‚≠êÔ∏è Successfully created a new blockchain 'gm'.
üëâ Get started with the following commands:

 % cd gm
 % ignite chain serve

Documentation: https://docs.ignite.com
```

This command has created a Cosmos SDK blockchain in the `gm` directory. The
`gm` directory contains a fully functional blockchain. The following standard
Cosmos SDK [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules) have been
imported:

- `staking` - for delegated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism
- `bank` - for fungible token transfers between accounts
- `gov` - for on-chain governance
- `mint` - for minting new units of staking token
- `nft` - for creating, transferring, and updating NFTs
- and [more](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/architecture/adr-043-nft-module.html)

Change to the `gm` directory:

```bash
cd gm
```

You can learn more about the `gm` directory‚Äôs file structure [here](https://docs.ignite.com/guide/hello#blockchain-directory-structure).
Most of our work in this tutorial will happen in the `x` directory.

### üíé¬†Installing Rollkit

To swap out Tendermint for Rollkit, run the following command:

```bash
go mod edit -replace github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk=github.com/rollkit/cosmos-sdk@v0.46.7-rollkit-v0.7.2-no-fraud-proofs
go mod edit -replace github.com/tendermint/tendermint=github.com/celestiaorg/tendermint@v0.34.22-0.20221202214355-3605c597500d
go mod tidy
go mod download
```

## üí¨¬†Say gm world

Now, we're going to get our blockchain to say `gm world!` - in order to do so
you need to make the following changes:

- Modify a protocol buffer file
- Create a keeper query function that returns data

Protocol buffer files contain proto RPC calls that define Cosmos SDK queries
and message handlers, and proto messages that define Cosmos SDK types. The RPC
calls are also responsible for exposing an HTTP API.

The `Keeper` is required for each Cosmos SDK module and is an abstraction for
modifying the state of the blockchain. Keeper functions allow us to query or
write to the state.

### ‚úã¬†Create your first query

**Open a new terminal instance that is not the
same that you started the chain in.**

In your new terminal, `cd` into the `gm` directory and run this command
to create the `gm` query:

```bash
ignite scaffold query gm --response text
```

Response:

```bash
modify proto/gm/gm/query.proto
modify x/gm/client/cli/query.go
create x/gm/client/cli/query_gm.go
create x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go

üéâ Created a query `gm`.
```

What just happened? `query` accepts the name of the query (`gm`), an optional
list of request parameters (empty in this tutorial), and an optional
comma-separated list of response field with a `--response` flag (`text` in this
tutorial).

Navigate to the `gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto` file, you‚Äôll see that `Gm` RPC has
been added to the `Query` service:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```protobuf title="gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto"
service Query {
  rpc Params(QueryParamsRequest) returns (QueryParamsResponse) {
    option (google.api.http).get = "/gm/gm/params";
  }
	rpc Gm(QueryGmRequest) returns (QueryGmResponse) {
		option (google.api.http).get = "/gm/gm/gm";
	}
}
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD010 -->

The `Gm` RPC for the `Query` service:

- is responsible for returning a `text` string
- Accepts request parameters (`QueryGmRequest`)
- Returns response of type `QueryGmResponse`
- The `option` defines the endpoint that is used by gRPC to generate an HTTP API

### üì®¬†Query request and response types

In the same file, we will find:

- `QueryGmRequest` is empty because it does not require parameters
- `QueryGmResponse` contains `text` that is returned from the chain

```protobuf title="gm/proto/gm/gm/query.proto"
message QueryGmRequest {
}

message QueryGmResponse {
  string text = 1;
}
```

### üëã¬†Gm keeper function

The `gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go` file contains the `Gm` keeper function that
handles the query and returns data.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->
```go title="gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go"
func (k Keeper) Gm(goCtx context.Context, req *types.QueryGmRequest) (*types.QueryGmResponse, error) {
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	_ = ctx
	return &types.QueryGmResponse{}, nil
}
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD010 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The `Gm` function performs the following actions:

- Makes a basic check on the request and throws an error if it‚Äôs `nil`
- Stores context in a `ctx` variable that contains information about the
environment of the request
- Returns a response of type `QueryGmResponse`

Currently, the response is empty and you'll need to update the keeper function.

Our `query.proto` file defines that the response accepts `text`. Use your text
editor to modify the keeper function in `gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go` .

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->
```go title="gm/x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go"
func (k Keeper) Gm(goCtx context.Context, req *types.QueryGmRequest) (*types.QueryGmResponse, error) {
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	_ = ctx
	return &types.QueryGmResponse{Text: "gm world!"}, nil
}
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD010 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### üü¢¬†Start your sovereign rollup

:::danger caution
Before starting our rollup, we'll need to find and change
`FlagIAVLFastNode` to `FlagDisableIAVLFastNode`:

```go title="gm/cmd/gmd/cmd/root.go"
baseapp.SetIAVLDisableFastNode(cast.ToBool(appOpts.Get(server.FlagDisableIAVLFastNode))),
```

Also, if you are on macOS, you will need to install md5sha1sum:

```bash
brew install md5sha1sum
```

:::

We have a handy `init.sh` found in this repo
[here](https://github.com/rollkit/docs/tree/main/docs/scripts/gm).

We can copy it over to our directory with the following commands:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```bash
# From inside the `gm` directory
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollkit/docs/main/docs/scripts/gm/init.sh
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

This copies over our `init.sh` script to initialize our
gm rollup.

You can view the contents of the script to see how we
initialize the gm rollup.

You can initialize the script with the following command:

```bash
bash init.sh
```

With that, we have kickstarted our `gmd` network!

The¬†`query`¬†command has also scaffolded
`x/gm/client/cli/query_gm.go`¬†that
implements a CLI equivalent of the gm query and mounted this command in
`x/gm/client/cli/query.go`.

In a separate window, run the following command:

```bash
gmd q gm gm
```

We will get the following JSON response:

```bash
text: gm world!
```

Congratulations üéâ you've successfully built your first rollup and queried it!
