GM world rollup: Part 2
Deploying to a Celestia devnet
This tutorial is part 2 of the GM world rollup tutorials. In this tutorial, it is expected that you've completed part 1 of the tutorial and are familiar with running a local rollup devnet.

The script for this tutorial is built for Celestia's Arabica devnet.

ðŸª¶ Run a Celestia light node
Fully sync and fund a light node on Arabica devnet (arabica-11). Follow instructions to install and start your Celestia data availability layer light node selecting the Arabica network. You can find instructions to install and run the node. After the node is synced, stop the light node.

ðŸŸ¢ Start your sovereign rollup
We have a handy init-arabica-testnet.sh found in this repo.

We can copy it over to our directory with the following commands:

bash
# From inside the `gm` directory
wget [init-arabica-testnet script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rollkit/docs/main/scripts/gm/init-arabica-testnet.sh)
This copies over our init-arabica-testnet.sh script to initialize our gm rollup.

You can view the contents of the script to see how we initialize the gm rollup.

TIP

init-arabica-testnet.sh script uses a default namespace 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000008e5f679bf7116cb. You can set your own by using a command similar to this (or, you could get creative ðŸ˜Ž):

bash
openssl rand -hex 10
Replace the last 10 characters in 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000008e5f679bf7116cb with the newly generated 10 characters.

Learn more about namespaces .

Clear previous chain history
Before starting the rollup, we need to remove the old project folders:

bash
rm -r $HOME/go/bin/gmd && rm -rf $HOME/.gm
Start the new chain
Now, you can initialize the script with the following command:

bash
bash init-arabica-testnet.sh
View your rollup by finding your namespace or account an Arabica devnet explorer.

With that, we have kickstarted our second gmd rollup!

Optional: Restarting your rollup
If you'd like to stop and restart your rollup for development purposes, you're in luck!

When you ran init-arabica-testnet.sh, the script generated a script called restart-testnet.sh in the $HOME/gm directory for you to use to restart your rollup.

In order to do so, restart celestia-da and then run:

bash
bash restart-testnet.sh
Optional: Add a "GM world" query
ðŸ’¬ Say gm world
Now, we're going to get our blockchain to say gm world! - in order to do so you need to make the following changes:

Modify a protocol buffer file
Create a keeper query function that returns data
Protocol buffer files contain proto RPC calls that define Cosmos SDK queries and message handlers, and proto messages that define Cosmos SDK types. The RPC calls are also responsible for exposing an HTTP API.

The Keeper is required for each Cosmos SDK module and is an abstraction for modifying the state of the blockchain. Keeper functions allow us to query or write to the state.

âœ‹ Create your first query
Open a new terminal instance that is not the same that you started the chain in.

In your new terminal, cd into the gm directory and run this command to create the gm query:

bash
ignite scaffold query gm --response text
Response:

bash
modify proto/gm/gm/query.proto
modify x/gm/client/cli/query.go
create x/gm/client/cli/query_gm.go
create x/gm/keeper/query_gm.go
