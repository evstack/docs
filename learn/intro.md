# Introduction

Welcome to the Rollkit docs. We're happy you made it here!
Our mission is to allow anyone to launch their own sovereign, customizable blockchain as easily as a smart contract by utilizing the shared security of a modular data availability network.

Rollkit is the first sovereign rollup framework, and we're setting the bar high for developers' flexibility and ability to customize rollups however they see fit.
