# Introduction to Rollkit

Welcome to the Rollkit docs. We're happy you made it here!

Rollkit is the first sovereign rollup framework.

Our mission is allow anyone to launch their own sovereign, customizable blockchain as easily as a smart contract by utilizing the shared security of a modular data availability network.

We're setting the bar high for developers' flexibility and ability to customize rollups however they see fit.
