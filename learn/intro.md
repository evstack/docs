# Introduction to Rollkit

Welcome to the Rollkit docs. We're happy you made it here!

Rollkit is the open modular framework for sovereign rollups.

Our mission is to empower developers to quickly innovate and create entire new classes of rollups with minimal tradeoffs.

We're setting the bar high for developers' flexibility and ability to customize rollups however they see fit.
