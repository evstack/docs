## Rollkit CLI

Requires Go version >= 1.21.

A cli tool that allows you to run different kinds of nodes for a rollkit network
while also helping you generate the required configuration files

### Install

To install `rollkit`, simply run the following command at the root of the
rollkit repo

```bash
make install
```

The latest Rollkit is now installed. You can verify the installation by running:

```bash
rollkit version
```

Explore the CLI documentation [here](./cmd/rollkit/docs/rollkit.md)

## Building with Rollkit

While Rollkit is a modular framework that aims to be compatible with a wide
range of data availability layers, settlement layers, and execution
environments, the most supported development environment is building on Celestia
as a data availability layer.

### Building on Celestia

You can build Rollkit rollups with [local-celestia-devnet](https://github.com/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet),
[arabica devnet](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/arabica-devnet) and
[mocha testnet](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/mocha-testnet) and
[mainnet beta](https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/mainnet).
